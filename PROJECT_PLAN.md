## 1. Protocol and Discovery Phase

### Research Objectives

- **1inch Fusion+ Mechanics**: Deeply study intent-based orders, hashlock/timelock contracts, resolvers, orderbooks, and relayers
- **Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps**: Analyze atomic swap techniques, especially the Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) pattern

### Key Deliverables

- [ ] 1inch Fusion+ protocol analysis document
- [ ] HTLC pattern implementation research
- [ ] Stellar/Soroban capabilities assessment

## 2. Bidirectional Atomic Swap Architecture Design

### 2.1 Swap Flow Definition

#### Requirements

- Create detailed flowcharts for swaps in both directions:
  - **Ethereum â†’ Stellar**
  - **Stellar â†’ Ethereum**
- Ensure each direction executes securely and atomically (either both chains settle, or neither)

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full bidirectional architecture with sequence diagrams created

### 2.2 Interface Design

#### Requirements

- Specify how off-chain components (relayer/resolver bots) interact with both blockchains
- Decide secret/nonce generation and propagation model
- Ensure secrets are revealed and claimable in both chains

### Key Deliverables

- [x] Bidirectional swap flow diagrams

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Enhanced contracts with full 1inch Fusion+ integration

#### Required Functions

### 3.2 Stellar Contracts

#### Required Functions

- `initializeSwap` - Initialize swap with parameters
- `claim` - Claim funds with preimage
- `refund` - Refund funds after timeout

#### Technical Requirements

- Enforce strict type/size compatibility for hashes and secrets (prefer SHA-256, 32-byte)
- Parallel event emissions compatible with off-chain monitoring
- Provide reference deployment and test asset IDs

### Key Deliverables

- [x] Ethereum HTLC smart contracts (`CrossChainHTLC.sol`, `MockERC20.sol`) - **ENHANCED**

## 4. Cross-Chain Relayer/Resolver Service

### Core Functionality

Build an off-chain backend/bot that:

#### Order Management

- Listens for intents/orders from the 1inch frontend or directly from users
- Submits/provisions HTLC contracts on both Ethereum and Stellar as required

#### Event Monitoring

- Monitors for escrow events (lock/claim/refund) on both chains
- Propagates secrets between chains to unlock corresponding escrows

#### Error Handling

- Handles edge cases: timeouts, failed claims, refunds
- Provides status feedback and notifications

### Key Deliverables

- [ ] Cross-chain resolver service
- [ ] Event monitoring system
- [ ] Secret propagation mechanism
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Status tracking and notifications

## 5. Onchain Execution and Demo Preparation

### Demo Requirements

Prepare scripts, tools, or a minimal frontend to:

#### Wallet Integration

- Connect accounts to both networks (MetaMask, Freighter, etc.)

#### Contract Deployment

- Deploy smart contracts on public Ethereum and Stellar testnets

#### Swap Demonstration

- Demonstrate both swap directions:
  - **ERC-20 â†’ Stellar Asset**
  - **Stellar Asset â†’ ERC-20**

#### Verification

  - Contract storage/state
  - Block explorer references for all steps
